This is a simple project aimed at creating a basic signage solution for a Raspberry Pi with fullpageOS 
and a few basic editing tools. The main focus is to have a digital sign that can be easily changed by
non-tech savvy employees on the fly as needed. The environment it is intended to be run in is a 
private club and the device itself is on a closed network so currently security is not a priority.
